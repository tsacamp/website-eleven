<p style="font-size:130%">Vincent Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853 in Zundert in the southern Netherlands. He was the son of a pastor. He started working in the Hague branch of an international art dealing firm. Van Gogh was disinterested by his job and was fired in 1876. He then became a preacher in a mining community in Belgium. In 1880 he decided to start drawing and painting. In 1886, Vincent joined his brother Theo in Paris. He met various artists there including: Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissaro and Gauguin. Gauguin and Van Gogh became close friends. In this period, Vincent painted a lot of self-portraits and in 1888, he relocated to Provence in France. Van Gogh asked his close friend Gauguin to join him but they started fighting and Vincent menaced Gauguin with a razor. He then severed his left ear because he felt bad. After that Van Gogh experienced a deterioration in his mental health and spent time in psychiatric hospitals.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:180%">Style and works</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%">Van Gogh was a Post-Impressionist. The definition of Post-Impressionism is: "the work or style of a varied group of late 19th-century and early 20th-century artists including Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Cézanne. They reacted against the naturalism of the impressionists to explore color, line, and form, and the emotional response of the artist, a concern which led to the development of expressionism."</p>
